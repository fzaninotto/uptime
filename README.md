You can watch a [demo screencast on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/39302164).

Features
--------

* Monitor thousands of websites (powered by [Node.js asynchronous programming](http://dotheweb.posterous.com/nodejs-for-php-programmers-1-event-driven-pro))
* Tweak frequency of monitoring on a per-check basis, up to the second
* Receive on screen notifications whenever a check goes down (powered by [socket.io](http://socket.io/))
* Receive email notifications whenever a check goes down
* Record availability statistics for further reporting (powered by [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/))
* Detailed uptime reports with animated charts (powered by [Flotr2](http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/))
* Monitor availability, responsiveness, average response time, and total uptime/downtime
* Get details about failed checks (HTTP error code, etc.)
* Group checks by tags and get reports by tag
* Familiar web interface (powered by [Twitter Bootstrap 2.0](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html))
* Complete API for integration with third-party monitoring services
* Easy installation and zero administration

Installing Uptime
-----------------

Uptime 3.0 requires Node.js 0.8 (if you're stuck with Node 0.6, try Uptime v1.4, available as a tag and on npm) and MongoDB 2.1.

To install from GitHub, clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm`:

    > git clone git://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime.git
    > cd uptime
    > npm install

Lastly, start the application with:

    > node app.js

Upgrading From a 2.0 Install
----------------------------

If you have been using uptime 1.0 or 2.0, you have to execute the migration script before using the new release.

    > node models/migrations/upgrade2to3

Adding Checks
-------------

By default, the web UI runs on port 8082, so just browse to 

    http://localhost:8082/

And you're ready to begin. Create your first check by entering an URL, wait for the first ping, and you'll soon see data flowing through your charts!

Configuring
-----------

Uptime uses [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) to allow YAML configuration and environment support. Here is the default configuration, taken from `config/default.yaml`:

```yaml
mongodb:
  server:   localhost
  database: uptime
  user:     root 
  password:
  connectionString:       # alternative to setting server, database, user and password separately

monitor:
  name:                   origin
  apiUrl:                 'http://localhost:8082/api' # must be accessible without a proxy
  pollingInterval:        10000      # ten seconds
  timeout:                5000       # five seconds
  userAgent:              NodeUptime/2.0 (https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime)

analyzer:
  updateInterval:         60000      # one minute
  qosAggregationInterval: 600000     # ten minutes
  pingHistory:            8035200000 # three months

autoStartMonitor: true

server:
  port:     8082
```

To modify this configuration, create a `development.yaml` or a `production.yaml` file in the same directory, and override just the settings you need. For instance, to run Uptime on port 80 in production, create a `production.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
server:
  port:     80
```

Node that Uptime works great behind a proxy - it uses the http_proxy environment variable transparently.

Monitoring From Various Locations
---------------------------------

Heavily browsing the web dashboard may slow down the server - including the polling monitor. In other terms, using the application can influence the uptime measurements. To avoid this effect, it is recommended to run the polling monitor in a separate process.

To that extent, set the `autoStartMonitor` setting to `false` in the `production.yaml`, and launch the monitor by hand:

    > node monitor.js &
    > node app.js

You can also run the monitor in a different server. This second server must be able to reach the API of the dashboard server: set the `monitor.apiUrl` setting accordingly in the `production.yaml` file of the monitor server.

You can even run several monitor servers in several datacenters to get average response time. In that case, make sure you set a different `monitor.name` setting for all monitor servers to be able to tell which server make a particular ping.

Using Plugins
-------------

Uptime provides plugins that you can enable to add more functionality.

To enable plugins, create a `plugins/index.js` module. This module must offer a public `init()` method, where you will require and initialize plugin modules. For instance, to enable only the `console` plugin:

```js
// in plugins/index.js
exports.init = function() {
  require('./console').init();
}
```

Currently supported plugins:

 * `console`: log pings and events in the console in real time
 * `email`: notify events (up, down pause) by email

You can customize plugins using the YAML configuration.

You can add your own plugins under the `plugins` directory. A plugin is simply a module with a public `init()` method. For instance, if you had to recreate a simple version of the `console` plugin, you could write it as follows:

```js
// in plugins/console/index.js
var CheckEvent = require('../../models/checkEvent');
exports.init = function() {
  CheckEvent.on('afterInsert', function(checkEvent) {
    checkEvent.findCheck(function(err, check) {
      console.log(new Date() + check.name + checkEvent.isGoDown ? ' goes down' : ' goes back up');
    });
  });
}
```

All Uptime entities emit lifecycle events that you can listen to on the Model class. These events are `beforeInsert`, `afterInsert`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`, `beforeSave` (called for both inserts and updates), `afterSave` (called for both inserts and updates), `beforeRemove`, and `afterRemove`. For more information about these events, check the [mongoose-lifecycle](https://github.com/fzaninotto/mongoose-lifecycle) plugin.

TODO
----

* Account for scheduled maintenance (and provide two QoS calculations: with and without scheduled maintenance)
* Allow for JavaScript execution in the monitored resources by using a headless browser (probably zombie.js)
* Unit tests
